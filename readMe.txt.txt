Programming Assessment – GitHub 

This simple web application uses the GitHub api to return a GitHub profile for a searched username. 
Type a GitHub username into the search bar and click the search icon. 
The profile will then load onto the page showing information about that user. 
These include name, username, profile picture, links to their GitHub page as well as many more. 
Links in the profile can be selected and will take you to that page. 
If a username that doesn’t exist is searched a pop up will tell the user this user does not exist.
